syslog-summary
==============

This program summarizes the contents of a log file written by syslog,
by displaying each unique (except for the time) line once, and also
the number of times such a line occurs in the input. The lines are
displayed in the order they occur in the input.

It is also possible to define some "ignore rules" using regular
expressions.
