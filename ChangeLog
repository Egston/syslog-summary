  * Added ability to read gzip compressed files, using python-magic or, if
    unavailable, os.path.splitext as fallback.
  * Added this ChangeLog file to track changes made to the sourcecode.
  * Moved regexp matching (ignore rules) earlier in the code (i.e. right
    after reading the line).
  * Using hashlib (Python 2.5) instead of the deprecated md5 module
  * printable_md5() removed: using hexdigest() method of the hashlib object.
  * Using SHA-1 instead of MD5 now.
  * Added rule to make a tarball to release :)
  * Code moved to GitHub, project management to Launchpad.
